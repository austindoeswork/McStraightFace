Precisely Estimate Position of Facial Landmarks

I = image

x_i E R^2
x_i == x,y coordinates of the i'th landmark

S = array of all coords
  aka Shape

S^(t) = current estimate of S

S^(t+1) = S^(t) + r_t(I, S^(t))

r_t = regressor
		makes predictions based on features such as pixel intensity from I
		relative to S^(t)

need to train r_t
